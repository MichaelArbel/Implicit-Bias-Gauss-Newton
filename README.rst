How to use
==========

- First install mlxp. You can find a documentation as an html page on the branch gh-pages. 
- You can launch experiments from a script: script.sh
- Options are contained in the file configs/config.yaml
- You can modify mlxp's options from the file configs/mlxp
- You can override options as in the script script.sh
- You also need to specify a path where to store logs and (eventually copies of the code). Recommended way is to create a sysmlink in this directory to another dir stored in a scratch disk. (Here the sysmlink is ./data).
